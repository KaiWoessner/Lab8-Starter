When we build a web app, we might want to include service workers for multithreaded computation and efficient internet requests. This can lower the general latency of our app as well as help to cache frequently accessed data in order to make our app quicker. However, we can also use the service workers to enable access to our app without the Internet. If a user does not have good or any access to the Internet, service workers can allow our app to still be used by caching the requests and responses that are crucial to our app so that they are readily available all within the user's browser.
